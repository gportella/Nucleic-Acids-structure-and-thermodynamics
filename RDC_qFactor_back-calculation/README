Back-calculate RDCs from MD trajectories (Gromacs XTC files)
using the theta method. 

We perform a rotational search for the optimal correlation between
calculated and experimental RDCs, and then back-calculate the 
RDCs. Ensemble and time averaged included. 

Requires Gromacs 4.6.3 

I believe that Makefile should work with a non-mpi version of gmx 4.6.3, I guess 
it does not work for mpi-compiled gmx. 

Once compiled ./g_qrdc -h should give you the options. These should be documented 
fine, but just in case you can also check the code.
