Duplex/Triplex Equilibrium 

A Makefile for the duplex and triplex versions of the programs
is supplied.

The current version requires a compiled non-MPI version of Gromacs 4.6. 
The program uses Gromacs functionality for parsing the arguments, dealing 
with memory and I/O. In the future we will eliminate this dependencies.
Before compiling, make sure to source this version of Gromacs.

The program also requires the GSL and GSL-C-Blas libraries to be installed
and available for linking.
