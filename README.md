##  Miscellaneous programs on NA structure and thermodynamics.

Some programs that might be useful to,

- Extract thermodynamics information from UV-monitored melting curves for triplex nucleic acids: [here](./Duplex_Triplex_NA_eq_from_UV_curves/)
- Caculate the sugar pucker for RNA/DNA nucleotides: [here](./g_puck/)
- Back-calculate residual dipolar couplings from MD trajectories: [here](./RDC_qFactor_back-calculation/)
- Calculate interaction energies between groups of protein/DNA atoms: [here](./NA_protein_interaction/)
- Extract the fraction of native base-pairs from and MD trajectory of nucleic acids: [here](./Native_fraction_NA_base_pairing/)
